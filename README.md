### Motivation
As an Assistant Intern in the **Global Luxe CRM & Loyalty team at L'Oréal, Paris** (June 2024 - September 2024), I developed a strong passion for analyzing beauty trends and product performance. This led me to select an open-source dataset on beauty and cosmetic products to gain deeper insights into market trends, product popularity, and bundling strategies.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains **15,000 beauty and cosmetic products**, covering details like:
- **Brand, Category, Price, Rating, Number of Reviews**
- **Usage Frequency, Skin Type, Packaging, Country of Origin**
- **Main Ingredients, Gender Target, Cruelty-Free Status**

## 2. Methodology  

### **🟢 Basic Python Programming**
- Used **variables, lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals** for data extraction.
- Created functions to compute **average ratings & prices per category**.

### **🟢 Data Manipulation**
- Checked for **missing values** and **duplicates**.
- Grouped data by **category, country, and cruelty-free status**.
- Sorted and filtered to extract **top-rated & most expensive products**.

### **🟢 Mathematical Operations**
- Calculated **average price per category**.
- Compared **cruelty-free vs. non-cruelty-free** product pricing.
- Identified **countries producing highest-rated products**.

### **🟢 Data Visualization**
- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Most common product categories  
- 🔎 **Scatter Plot**: Price vs. Rating, Number of reviews vs. Price  
- 📈 **Histogram**: Rating distribution  
- 📦 **Box Plot**: Price distribution across categories  

### **🟢 SQL Integration**
Stored dataset in **SQL Database** & executed queries:
- **Which category has the highest average rating?**
- **Which brand has the most expensive products?**
- **Which country produces the highest-rated products?**

## 3. Findings  

### **📌 Key Business Insights**
1️⃣ **Product Bundling**:  
   - Skin care products lead in popularity.  
   - Creating **beauty kits** (bundled products) can increase sales.  

2️⃣ **Customer Segmentation**:  
   - Wide price range (mostly under $100 USD).  
   - **Luxury buyers** can be targeted with specialized marketing.  

3️⃣ **Price vs. Rating**:  
   - Higher prices **do not always** correlate with better ratings.  
   - Companies should **focus on product quality over price increases**.

## 4. Conclusion & Recommendations  

✅ **For Businesses:** Implement **bundling strategies** to encourage purchases.  
✅ **For Consumers:** Price **≠** Quality. **Trust ratings & reviews** before purchasing.  
✅ **For Marketing:** Create **loyalty programs** (discounts, rewards, coupons).  
✅ **Future Work:** Sentiment analysis on customer reviews for **deeper insights**.
